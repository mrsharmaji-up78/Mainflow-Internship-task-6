#Data Analysis and Data Science with Python
This repository contains two projects that focus on data analysis and machine learning techniques using Python.

#Project 1: Time Series Analysis
Objective: Analyze sales data over time and forecast future sales using statistical models.

Steps to Follow:
Dataset Selection

Includes columns: Date (timestamp) and Sales (units sold or revenue).
Tasks to Perform

Visualize sales trends using line charts or moving averages.
Identify patterns like seasonality and trends.
Apply ARIMA for forecasting.
Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE or MAPE.
Deliverables

Forecasted sales dataset.
Visualizations for historical and predicted sales.

#Project 2: Predicting Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression
Objective: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on key medical parameters.

Steps to Follow:
Dataset Selection

Dataset: heart_disease.csv with features like Age, Gender, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, and Heart Disease.
Tasks to Perform

Load and clean the dataset.
Perform feature engineering for better model performance.
Train a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluate model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Deliverables

Trained model for heart disease prediction.
Evaluation report with performance metrics.

#Tools Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
scikit-learn, statsmodels for machine learning and forecasting
